description: "Generate a multi-leg camera flight or a conditioned still through the gflow hand (Google Flow / Veo / Imagen on a subscription), using the verify-then-spend adapter so a stranded render never costs a second credit. Use when a brief needs authored video legs whose seams must be frame-identical; do not use for one-off text-to-video where the official API path is simpler, and never inside CI or an unattended build."
