description: "Decide how faithfully to track a reference input. Use when a workflow consumes a screenshot, URL, or Figma frame and must choose between faithful reproduction and inspired reinterpretation."

Follow the runtime-neutral skill at:

The workflow reads files under `knowledge/`. Resolve every such path against this absolute base: `/Users/m4/.local/node/lib/node_modules/ease-design/knowledge` (e.g. `knowledge/persona-index.md` → `/Users/m4/.local/node/lib/node_modules/ease-design/knowledge/persona-index.md`).
